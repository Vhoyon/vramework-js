# vramework-js

---

_**Discontinued**_ : Instead of making our own framework, we use [discord-nestjs](https://github.com/fjodor-rybakov/discord-nestjs) instead.

---

This repository is currently being used as a testing ground to try and recreate the functionnalities of the [Vramework](https://github.com/Vhoyon/Vramework) framework, but in Typescript instead of Java.

Stay tuned!
